# Fitness_App
A distributed Fitness Tracking Application built using Spring Boot Microservices. This project demonstrates clean microservice architecture with separate services for Users, Activities, and a Service Discovery Server (Eureka).  Communication between services happens using Spring WebClient, enabling reactive and non-blocking calls.
